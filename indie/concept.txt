"Real estate" of the public space forces members to be choosy.

Real estate?

Artists   - Number of pixels.
Musicians - Seconds of audio.
Writers   - Number of characters.
Coders    - Bytes of code.
Proposals - Pixel-seconds of video.

Forcing members to be choosy increases quality.  As a member's posts gain
more revenue, they can get more real estate.

Good for the artist (more visibility), good for the company (more money!)
